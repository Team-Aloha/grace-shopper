# Code Review 1

* Is there a server-side logger setup? I'm not seeing server-side logs?
* I love that you're written some tests! Keep doing that.
* Vertical development rather than horizontal.
* Export unconnected components and test those.
* Its important to spend time learning and solidifying knowledge, just like
in Jr phase. But we're also learning about productivity and velocity. Its worth
becoming a little bit more comfortable with "I don't completely know how this works,
but hey it works."
